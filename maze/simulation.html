    <h2>Maze Generation Algorithms</h2>
    <center>
      <p>
        Maze algorithms are used to generate mazes. They are given a grid of cells separated by walls, and they output a
        maze by systematically breaking down a set of walls. Due to the method of generation, it is assured that there is
        only one path between two points in the maze. There are several maze generation algorithms, each with their own
        pros and cons in terms of length of passages, frequency and length of dead ends, and computational resources
        demanded.

    <b>1) Iterated Depth First Search: </b> Maintains a stack of cells whose neighbors haven't been explored yet
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>A random cell is chosen, marked as visited, and pushed to the stack</li>
      <li>While the stack is not empty, the following steps are carried out:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>The last cell from the stack is obtained and designated as the current cell</li>
        <li>If it has any neighboring cell(s) that have not been visited yet, then the current cell is again added to the
          stack. An unvisited neighbor is chosen at random, marked as visited, and designated as the chosen cell. The wall
          between the current cell and the chosen cell is removed. The chosen cell is pushed to the stack</li>
        <li>If it does not have any neighboring unvisited cells, then its exploration potential has been fully utilized
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The current cell is painted yellow. Cells that are suspected of having unexplored neighbors are red, while those
      that surely don't have any unexplored neighbors are blue.
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>2) Randomized Kruskal:</b> Requires a randomized list of all walls and a list of sets, each containing only one cell at
      the beginning
    <p>
      For each wall in the list of walls, if the cells divided by the wall lie in disjoint sets, then the wall is removed
      and the sets are merged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cells whose parent sets have been merged at least once are colored blue. The current wall is stroked yellow.
    </p>
    <br>

    <b>3) Randomized Prim:</b> Requires a stack of walls which surround the currently visited cells.
    <p>
    <ol>
      <li>A random cell is chosen, marked as visited. Its surrounding walls are pushed to the stack</li>
      <li>While the wall stack is not empty, the following steps are repeated:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>A random wall is selected from the stack. If either cell separated by the wall is unvisited, then the
          unvisited cell is marked as visited, and its surrounding walls are added to the stack</li>
        <li>The aforementioned wall is removed from the stack as well as the maze.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Visited cells are marked with blue and the wall under consideration is stroked with yellow.

    <ol class="browser-default">
      <li>Iterated Depth First Search: Has a bias for generating long corridors, due to its very method of operation.
        Considerably difficult for humans to solve. Moderate space and time complexity</li>
      <li>Randomized Kruskal: Generates a lot of small dead-ends. Simple for humans to solve. High space complexity and
        moderate time complexity</li>
      <li>Randomized Prim: Generates more dead-ends than Kruskal. Extremely simple for humans to solve. Moderate space and
        time complexity. Considerable resources wasted on redundant tasks</li>
    </ol>
